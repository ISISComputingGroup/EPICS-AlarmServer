The Alarm Server
----------------

The alarm_server_settings.ini file contains the settings for connecting to the MySql database and the Java Message Service.

To run the alarm server use run_alarm_server.bat.
This file will need to be edited to point at the correct root (currently set to test).

To stop the alarm server close the window that is spawned on starting

The file config_name.ini contains the name of the root configuration to be used when the server is started using the 'procserv_start.bat' script.
