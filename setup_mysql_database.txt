The Alarm server needs a running instance of MySQl - see CSS/ArchiveEngine/setup_mysql_database.txt to install MySQl if
it is not already done this

Once mysql is started, you need to load ALARM_MYSQL.sql and MYSQL_USER.sql from the dbd directory

from a command prompt run:

    mysql -u root -p < ALARM_MYSQL.sql
    mysql -u root -p < MYSQL_USER.sql

and when prompted for a password give the MySQl admin password you previous set
